I love when the subreddit shows Bill some love! We have so many people that keep an ear to the ground for quality Bill content.,joy
Oh bless your heart. I found this so funny. Goodness.,joy
It’s not so much that I enjoy money and more that I do enjoy scamming people.,joy
Im glad Bill was there for us,joy
Good to hear - I am glad you at least have that choice.,joy
Imagine making a homophobic joke when your name is /u/Lebronlover23 OOF.,joy
I love how a few words can turn a post from believable bragging to complete bullshit.,joy
Damn! A 4-pack! That’s awesome.,joy
Wow that's just like when I sing it,joy
"I have, and now that you mention it, I think that's what triggered my nostalgia. ",joy

Sometimes those are the only options. Laughing makes other people feel better at least so that's what you gotta do.,joy
That's exactly what I would expect Bill parents to look like lol,joy
He happily accepts the hugs. He hugs me now and again. He also has no problem accepting hugs from his mum.,joy
That’s so nice! Kindness like this makes my heart happy.,joy
It's cool and fun and a nice change of pace but I want my hidden blades back next game.,joy
Glad you got to see a good one!,joy
Yikes. This kind of freaks me out.,joy

I think there’s something to the concept that overindulgence in technology contributes to a lack of physical and emotional bonding these days.,joy
Here's my Bill. and Bill in front of our tree :),joy
I love it when people delete their whiny comments and then try to reply with something snarky,joy
In good news today: she broke up with him!! Right after he told her he’ll never love her the way she loves him 🙄,joy

The important thing is that you're having fun,joy
I actually got offered way more pay to stay but no amount of money is worth my mental health. Woot for new beginnings!,joy
